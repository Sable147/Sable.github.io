				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>I'm Ole, also known as [Sable] (or Sable147 whenever I can't use square brackets) and I do a few different things. I try to show a few of these things here, but note that there are some things not shown here.</p>

				<h1>Photography</h1>
				<p>I mostly enjoy taking pictures of things that are not neccecarily on the same giant rock as I am, but there are some exceptions.</p>
				<p>I would have embedded some instagram posts here, but instagram doesn't allow you to embed posts in a sensible way. If you want to see more photos, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sable147/">here</a> is my Instagram profile.</p>

				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>Whenever I get the opportunity, I really love mixing live concerts. Unfortunately, didn't have many opportunities do that in the recent past because of <i>something</i>, but because of that I also do some broadcast video now.</p>

			<div class="right">
				<h1>Speedrunning</h1>
				<p>I used to do Portal Glitchless speedruns before my PC powersupply decided to do a kamekazi at one of the worst possible times. My PB is at 24:22.950, which was rank 420 at the time.</p>
				<p>I do want to get into running other games, but with my current hardware, I'm lucky when Doom (the 1993 one) runs with over 30 FPS whithout recording.</p>
				<p>When the time comes, you'll find new runs on my <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/Sable147">Speedrun.com</a> page.

				<h1>Development</h1>
				<p>I do write a few lines of code every now and then, but most of doesn't ever get released publicly. The last project I did was a redesign of the <a href="http://fuk-team.tk">FUK-Team</a> website, a homebrew development team, of which I am one of the three most inactive members. Sadly, a certain <i>someone</i> responsible for the server hasn't updated the public version on the server yet. </p>
